# Custom-Popup-Contact-Form
Custom Contactform Wordpress pop-up

I wanted to have an contactform on the product page but didn't want to use too much space. Here I'll offer the code and the how to install.

How to install

- Download the .zip and open the files in an editor.
- Go to your wp-admin and find and click Contact > Add New. Give the new Form a Title to your liking.
- Copy and paste all the code from 'index.html' and paste it into 'Form'. ---- Save it! -----
- Go, in your wp-admin, to your advanced options where you can add custom CSS and custom scripts (for me this was Flatsome > Advanced).
- Copy and paste the CSS from the 'style.css' file into the 'Custom CSS' area. (for me this was Flatsome > Advanced > Custom CSS)
- Copy and paste everything from 'script.js' (OR use 'script-stop.js' if you don't want the form to return after sending) into the custom     script area (footer script). (for me this was Flatsome > Advanced > Global Settings > Footer Scripts) ------ Save All Changes! -----
- Place the form on your Page.

Notes:

- The placement is somewhat weird. Place a "gap" element of approximately 90px above the form.
- In order to have the icons I installed a plugin named: "Better Font Awesome".

- You can customize to your liking in the Custom CSS.
- Free for use and customization.
