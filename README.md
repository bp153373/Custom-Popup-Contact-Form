# Custom-Popup-Contact-Form
Custom Contactform Wordpress pop-up



I wanted to have an contactform on the product page but didn't want to use too much space. Here I'll offer the code and the how to install.

How to install

- Download the .zip and open the files in an editor.
- Go to your wp-admin and find and click Contact > Add New. Give the new Form a Title to your liking.
- Copy and paste all the code from 'index.html' and paste it into 'Form'. ---- Save it! -----
- Copy and paste the CSS from the 'style.css' file into the 'Custom CSS' area.
- Copy and paste everything from 'script.js' into the custom script area (footer script). ------ Save All Changes! -----
- Place the form on your Page/Product.

Notes:
- In order to have the icons I installed a plugin named: "Font Awesome".

- You can customize to your liking in the Custom CSS.
- Free for use and customization.

UPDATE:
- Fixed: Placement was to high and got out of container.
